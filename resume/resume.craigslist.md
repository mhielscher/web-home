Matt Hielscher
==============

I am a web developer specializing in backend development with several years of freelance, part-time, and personal project experience.

I've professionally developed for the web, and for fun I've done game and internet application development. I have strong experience with Python, PHP, Linux, Apache, MySQL, and HTTP; and practical experience with Laravel and other MVC frameworks, Flask, jQuery, Handlebars, and third-party REST APIs.

I'm looking for a small company or startup in the Sacramento area with an established development team ready to expand with another developer.
