"Simple" Beef Stew
==================

- 2-3 pounds beef chuck roast, blade roast, pot roast, cross rib roast, boneless short ribs, or "stew meat"
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons oil, divided use
- 2 medium onions, sliced or large-chopped
- 1/2 small can tomato paste
- 1 head garlic, peeled and smashed, pressed, or minced
- 2-3 large carrots, or 2-3 handfuls of baby carrots
- 1-2 pounds potatoes
- 1/2 bag frozen peas, or 1 can peas, drained
- 1 carton beef stock, or 2 cans beef broth
- alcohol: 1 cup of red wine; or 1 shot of whiskey; or 1/2 cup of soju; whatever's not sweet
- 2 bay leaves (opt.)
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- salt & pepper

Cut the meat into 1- to 1-1/2-inch cubes, if needed. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pot on medium-high heat until it's very hot. Add half the meat, sprinkle with half the flour, stir to coat, and brown well. Remove the meat to a plate, and repeat with the other half of the meat and flour.

Before the residue in the pot can burn, turn the heat down to medium, add the remaining tablespoon of oil, and add the onion. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook the onion until it just starts to brown. Add the tomato paste, stir to coat the onion, and cook until it darkens slightly.

Pour in the splash of whatever dry alcohol you have. Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon while the alcohol boils down.

Return the meat to the pot, along with any juices it lost. Add the beef stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Increase heat to high, bring to a boil, stir, then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 1 hour.

Cut the carrots and potatoes into pieces about the same size as the meat (peel if desired). Add to the pot, stir to combine, cover with a lid, and simmer for another hour, until the vegetables and meat are tender. Stir occasionally.

Stir in the peas. If using frozen, simmer another 5 minutes. Taste, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve with a big hunk of crusty bread.
