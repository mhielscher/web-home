A students elective course program must be approved by a departmental faculty advisor. The advisor will check the program to ensure satisfaction of the departmental requirements. A wide variety of elective programs will be considered acceptable. Sample programs include those with emphasis in solid state, in high frequency electronics and communications, in communications, controls, and signal processing, and in computer engineering.</p>
				<p class="txt-body-">Three matters should be noted: (1) students who fail to attain a grade-point average of at least 2.0 in the major may be denied the privilege of continuing in the major, (2) a large majority of electrical and computer engineering courses have prerequisites which must be completed successfully. Successful completion of prerequisite courses means receiving a grade of C- or better in prerequisite courses except for Mathematics 3A-B-C and Mathematics 5A and 5B which require a grade of C or better to apply these courses as prerequisites, (3) courses required for the pre-major or major, inside or outside of the Department of Electrical Engineering, cannot be taken for the passed/not passed grading option. They must be taken for letter grades.</p>

              <p class="txt-1st-">The department offers graduate programs at the M.S. and Ph.D. levels in electrical and computer engineering. The graduate programs are open to those who have a bachelors degree in electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, other areas of engineering, or in mathematics, physics, or other related fields of science. Applicants with degrees in fields other than electrical and computer engineering or computer science may be required to complete undergraduate prerequisite courses. Fundamental subject areas required include mathematics through differential equations and advanced calculus, a full year of college-level physics, and introductory computer programming.</p>
				<p class="txt-body-">All applicants for admission to graduate status are required to present evidence of a high level of technical skill, scholarship, and aptitude for electrical and computer engineering. This evidence normally is provided through a combination of undergraduate transcripts, scores on the verbal, quantitative, and analytical sections (required) and advanced portion (optional) of the Graduate Record Examination, letters of recommendation, and accounts of professional goals and experience. Applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Exceptions to this requirement will be considered for those students who have completed an undergraduate or graduate education at an institution whose primary language of instruction is English. The minimum score for consideration is 550 when taking the paper-based test and 213 when taking the computer-based test.</p>
				<p class="txt-body-">The department emphasizes graduate education at the highest level and intends that most of its graduate students will be enrolled in the Ph.D. program. Admission to the Ph.D. program is open to applicants who hold a masters degree or its equivalent in either electrical and computer engineering or computer science or related fields and who demonstrate unusual ability and promise for professional success. It is also open to applicants of exceptional promise directly on completion of a baccalaureate degree program. Applicants with only a baccalaureate degree who intend to seek the Ph.D. degree should apply for simultaneous admission to the M.S. and Ph.D. programs. It should be noted, however, that continuation in the Ph.D. program is dependent upon proof of competency to pursue research at the Ph.D. level and upon obtaining a research supervisor.</p>
