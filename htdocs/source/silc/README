One important note:
This directory does not include all files required for building SILC Aqua.
Use this directory only for browsing the source; if you want to compile
SILC Aqua, download silc.tar.gz in the parent directory. The tarball includes
important files like the project file and nib files.

SILC Aqua also requires installation of the SILC toolkit, obtainable from
http://silcnet.org/software/developers/toolkit/.
