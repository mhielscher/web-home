			I was supposed to finish updating and upload this site over a week ago.
			Maybe I'm lazy, or maybe I'm ADD, because the lack of updates is not due
			to busyness (though it really should be). Anyway, there is more news on
			the <a href="theory.html">Theory page</a> that you can look at. Hopefully
			soon I'll have a new useful utility, and maybe even a service offered. I'm
			tempted to buy a couple $1 Lithium 3.4V 1050mAH batteries and some camera
			flash chargers from GoldMine Electronics so I can resume work on my portable
			gun (yes, the <a href="http://www.pskovinfo.ru/coilgun/indexe.htm">Pskov
			1100</a> inspired me). Stay tuned.
			<p>
			And you should note that the official address for this site is
			<a href="http://mattsmac.ath.cx/electronics/">
			http://mattsmac.ath.cx/electronics/</a>, not mattspowermac.ath.cx as it was
			on the December 18th update.

            Sixteen months later to the day, comes another update. Much happened in 2003
			to progress my coilgun's development (the homescale gun; the portable
			one has seen no progress since June '02). This will be a long update.
			<P>
			Shortly after my last update in December 2002, I started my last semester
			of high school, the highlight of which was the Electricity and Magnetism
			portion of Physics. The course gave me what I needed to rework the equations
			in my EMF Simulator. Unfortunately, I could only do it on paper - I lost all
			the Java source files in a hasty reformat when switching to a new computer,
			and they weren't uploaded anywhere. I guess that's just fate.
			My Physics teacher saw my interest in the subject, and urged me to write
			a <a href="abstract.html">research abstract</a> including applications other
			than as a weapon; the abstract was later published in the 2003 Journal of
			Student Research Abstracts.
			<P>
			Okay, so good for me, I got something published. How does that advance the
			coilgun? Associated with the abstract was a "poster session" at Cal State
			Northridge in May, which for me meant a demonstration. That gave me the
			deadline I needed to get me working again. I wanted a solid, presentable
			device, so I tore apart what I had, got a lot more cardboard (my building
			base of choice) and started drawing out a new circuit. The
			<a href="pictures.html">pictures</a> and <a href="homescale.html">project
			page</a> show how it turned out, using my RIFA capacitor and a step-up
			circuit to charge at 340 volts. Now, I said this was a poster session,
			so I still needed a poster. Taking all the equations I had but never put
			to use, I simplified, approximated, and processed and ended up with
			my math-intensive <a href="graphics/coilgunpostersmall.gif">poster</a>. It was a hit
			at the poster session, I assure you.
			<P>
			Jump to January, 2004. I'm starting my second quarter in college (University
			of California, Santa Barbara), taking my first programming class in Java,
			and in determining if it's possible to decompile the professor's example
			programs (I never did, really!), I realize I could also use such a decompiler to
			resurrect my Simulator Applet. And so I find one, and decompile the .class
			file that remained archived at the original site. Bingo, I can now resume
			work. Using the formulas from my poster, I tweaked and rewrote such that it
			would comply with what I had calculated. And this time, I uploaded the code
			to share and for safekeeping, but I didn't have the time or desire to
			update the site.
			<P>
			Until now.
			<P>
			Because I'm here at college, with no room to spare, I don't have my coilgun
			with me. I'm taking classes here over the first part of the summer, but I'll
			have a bigger space to work in then, so I might just bring my project back
			here to have something to do. If not, I'll be working on it as soon as I'm
			back home.

          <TD WIDTH="100%">
            <P>You could have guessed by now that I've given up on my coilgun.
            This is <B>not</B> true! I haven't been working on it for a long
            time, but I haven't given up. My coilgun is in storage for the
            moment, but I've been thinking about it and I have a great new
            idea that I may try much later: the force on the projectile is
            directly proportional to the amount of iron in it, and because
            it's all iron, that means the mass. So as the mass increases,
            so does the force. However, acceleration is directly proportional
            to the force and inversely proportional to the mass, so this
            &quot;decrease&quot; exactly balances out the increase caused
            by mass. Now, if we make the coil the projectile, and surround
            the center of the barrel with an iron mass, then we're dealing
            with two masses: the one that increases the force can be varied
            and very large, while the mass of the projectile, which decreases
            the acceleration, can remain the same. I'll be trying this out
            not before March, but hopefully no later than August.</P>

            <P>I've also moved the site to <A HREF="http://mattspowermac.ath.cx/electronics/index.html">my
            own server</A> since I got Mac OS X 10.2 Server. My <A HREF="http://www.pacificnet.net/~restorer/electronics/index.html">old
            site</A> will remain as a mirror, but I can't guarantee updates.

            <P>As you can see from the hiatus from updates, I've been back
            in school. On my free time I've been working on my EMF Simulator,
            a preliminary version of which I've uploaded. It will calculate
            the attraction on a projectile with a capacitor discharge system.
            Soon to come: calculations for the changing inductance brought
            on by the projectile, energy &quot;stolen&quot; from the circuit
            by the accelerating projectile, and even an option to test with
            an iron shell around the coil. The source code will be available
            soon.</P>

            <P>I've done very little work on my own coilguns. My portable
            one is in storage until I get the time and resources to work
            on it (I still haven't been able to find the right batteries
            for my multimeter). My larger one is now in a cat litter box
            so I can move it off my table every once in a while. I've put
            a cardboard shelf over the top to hold the coil with barrel and
            the switches. All the capacitors and charging circuits are below,
            out of reach. I'll have pictures when I get around to uploading
            them. I get my break in 2 months, so I might not be too active
            until then.

            <P>Wired together 15 of my 25 capacitors, but ran out of solder.
            I tested it first with only 3 capacitors and the projectile was
            able to penetrate a cardboard box. I tried again with all 15,
            but the suckback was too great - it only bounced off the box.
            I found that the optimum was 4. So I got my Dad to give me an
            advance on my birthday money, and I'll get some SCRs to use with
            <A HREF="multistage.gif">this circuit</A> (<A HREF="pulsegen.gif">optically

            cable. No worries, I have other ways to &quot;develop&quot; my
            pics. Took some great ones of my whole setup and the target box.</P>

            <P>I'm writing this at 12:38 am Thursday night (technically Friday),
            but because I don't have the pictures yet it won't get to you
            until Sunday night. I know I said I'd update sooner, but I couldn't
            bear the other camera, and without pictures I had nothing to
            update about.</P>

            <P>Wow, just fixed a lot of typos. I really have to stop updating
            in the middle of the night. It would be cool to get some little
            smilies too...
