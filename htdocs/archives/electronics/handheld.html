      <P>My handheld coilgun will be a much more compact, portable
      weapon than my home-scale model. It will fire 30mm x 2mm diameter
      projectiles, and will store about 100 joules in 12 photoflash
      capacitors. My heavy-duty flash charger blew itself up on the
      large load, so I've ordered a few CCFT inverters which I will
      rectify and feed into the caps. The coil, firing tube, and trigger
      switch will be mounted on a gun-like handle, while the capacitors
      and charger will be in a pocket-sized module with a belt-clip.</P>

          <TD WIDTH="84%">I used the same carbon fiber tubing here as I
            did for my larger model. The coil is made from 24 AWG wire that
            I took from an old transformer. It had a red sticky adhesive
            on it that really aided in making tight turns. It is five layers
            thick and 30mm long. I'm not sure how, but I'll be mounting it
            on a plastic handle. The projectile will load from the back and
            project 8.5mm into the coil (the measured optimum on <A HREF="http://www.oz.net/~coilgun/home.html">Barry's
            site</A>, but I can adjust it for my optimum). I'm guessing that
            the maximum speed I'll be able to get with a fine-tuned power
            source is 30 m/sec, but that's enough for me. I'm using a CCFT
            (fluorescent light) inverter that will step 3 volts up to around
            300/330 which will charge the capacitors when rectified. A neon
            lamp will tell me when they are fully charged.</TD>

            <P>As with the home-scaler, I have some steps in this coilgun:</P>

            <UL>
              <LI>Charger Test: Can charge all 12 caps and discharge them through
              the coil without damage to the charger - <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Failed</FONT></B>
              <UL>
                <LI>Secondary Trigger Test: If above fails (blows out the SCR)
                but still charges, it can discharge the coil through the caps
                directly - <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Failed</FONT></B>
              </UL>
              <LI>Coil Test: Can fire the projectile successfully - Not Done
              <LI>Switch Test: Can use a light switch to fire at 10 m/sec or
              greater - Not Done
              <LI>SCR Switch: Can use an SCR to fire at 10 m/sec or greater
              - Not Done
              <LI>SCR Optimization: Can use an SCR to fire at 20 m/sec or greater
              - Not Done
              <LI>Full Power: Can fire at 25 m/sec or greater - Not Done
            </UL>

            <P>My first tests with charging the capacitor bank destroyed
            the camera charger. As soon as my inverters arrive I will continue
            with disassembled firing, but I need to get a good SCR in order
            to make it truly portable. I might have to turn it into a rifle
            design to make it all fit convieniently, but with the small size
            of my bank it may be possible to fit even up to 500 joules without
            having to change my model.
