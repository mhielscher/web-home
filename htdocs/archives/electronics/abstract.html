Strong magnetic fields, such as those created by a solenoid, attract matter
that is ferromagnetic, such as iron and steel. A model electromagnetic
attraction accelerator ("Coilgun") uses currents in upwards of 100, or even
1000, amps created by current from charged capacitors to rapidly attract a
steel slug. The RLC reaction between the capacitors, the solenoid, and the
resistance of the wire creates a nearly sinusoidal pulse rising from 0 amps
to maximum current in less than a millisecond in most cases. At the peak, all
the energy that was contained in the capacitors is now in the magnetic field
surrounding the solenoid. A diode in reverse-parallel to the coil discharges
the energy back through the coil, in order to protect the capacitors from
back-emf. This quick discharge of the magnetic field dissipates it and
prevents the projectile from being pulled back into the coil. Maximum
efficiency (the ratio of kinetic energy of the projectile to total initial
energy in the capacitors) is attained when the projectile is the same length
as the coil, and the tip of the projectile is just past the entrance to the
coil at peak current.

An application of this model is as a levitation device for ferromagnetic
objects. A ball bearing or any small iron object could be levitated along
the axis of a wide solenoid parallel to the ground with constant current.
This could be useful for noiseless levitating fans or motors. Resistance
could be adjusted manually to achieve maximum efficiency or to release the
levitating object.

Another application is as a delivery system for liquid oxygen in a low-oxygen
environment, such as outer space. Oxygen is paramagnetic, and magnetic fields
of the strength produced by this device could provide enough kinetic energy to
liquid oxygen "pellets" to rapidly enter a combustion chamber. This could lead
to an engine analogous to an internal combustion engine that is functional in
low-pressure, low-oxygen environments.
