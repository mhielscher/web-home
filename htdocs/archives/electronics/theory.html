	  I realized recently that I have a Windows PC now, so I went ahead
	  and downloaded FEMM. I played around with it a little, modelling
	  my coilgun, and the values were coming out as I expected; about as
	  my simulator applet predicted. I modelled the coil-on-projectile
	  idea, but in order to fit in the tube, the wire gauge would have to
	  be so low that the
	  field would be too small to be worth it. The force FEMM calculated
	  was way below a normal coilgun's force, even with a huge mass of
	  iron. I haven't written any Lua scripts yet, but I think soon I
	  will write a complete simulator script to use FEMM to do what my
	  simulator does now, but more accurately <b>and</b> taking into
	  account the change in inductance (or at least flux and velocity)
	  as the projectile moves into the coil.
	  <p>

	  In my last update, I was thinking about reversing the roles
	  of the coil and the projectile. Shortly after writing that,
	  I tried to try it; I never actually got to try it because the
	  make-shift mini-coil I wrapped around one of my normal nail
	  projectiles wouldn't fit into the barrel.
	  <p>
	  A few days ago that got me thinking about the relation of mass to 
	  efficiency. I plugged some numbers into Barry's inductance applet
	  and into my own simulator, trying different projectile diameters
	  for constant coil inductance while keeping the coil closely coupled
	  to the projectile. It turns out that for my coilgun, I could jump
	  from my current 0.3% efficiency to possibly 3.7% efficiency if I
	  would use a projectile with diameter 15mm. I could get a 2.8%
	  efficiency if I used a more standard 9mm projectile, 28mm long
	  (with a matching coil). Of course, the velocity is smaller, but the
	  mass makes up for it in kinetic energy. There is an optimum diameter,
	  though: a coil of constant inductance can't have too large an inner
	  diameter, or it will lose magnetic influence (field) on the projectile.
	  A large 40mm shell will have the same kinetic energy as my 2mm nails.
	  <p>
	  My quest now is to find a good source of small caliber solid iron or
	  steel slugs, and matching barrels. After that, I'll check out
	  stabilization with elliptical coils, because rifling barrels is too
	  much work for this project.

	  <i>From the news page...</i><br>
	  My coilgun is in storage for the moment, but I've been thinking
	  about it and I have a great new idea that I may try much later:
	  the force on the projectile is directly proportional to the amount
	  of iron in it, and because it's all iron, that means the mass. So
	  as the mass increases, so does the force. However, acceleration is
	  directly proportional to the force and inversely proportional to
	  the mass, so this "decrease" exactly balances out the increase
	  caused by mass. Now, if we make the coil the projectile, and
	  surround the center of the barrel with an iron mass, then we're
	  dealing with two masses: the one that increases the force can be
	  varied and very large, while the mass of the projectile, which
	  decreases the acceleration, can remain the same.
	  
	  Explanations of all the math involved are available for each applet.

      <H3>Pulse Width and Shape</H3>

      <P>After learning Java, the first applet I created was this one.
      It inputs data from your coilgun and graphs the current flowing
      through the inductor. I've refashioned it with new formulas and
      cleaned up the interface since then, and it's still a work in
      progress.</P>

      CLEAR="ALL"><A HREF="http://home.san.rr.com/nessengr/techdata/rlc/rlc.html">NET
      - Formulas Used for RLC</A></P>

      <P>I plan to continue development; implementing the &quot;Transistor
      Switch&quot; option, improving the graph accuracy and speed with
      a Runge-Kutta or similar model, and providing extra exact data,
      such as the time the peak current occured and the time of zero
      crossing (all currently calculable at the <A HREF="http://web2.airmail.net/jd4usa/">MGC</A>).</P>

      <H3>HAPES</H3>

      <P>The High Amperage Procedure Evaluation System is really just
      a useful multi-directional formula calculator. The segment titled
      &quot;Energy in a Capacitor&quot; can calculate the energy stored
      in a given capacitor, or reverse the equation and calculate the
      capacitance or voltage you need to acheive a certain energy level.<BR>
      The &quot;Projectile Speed&quot; segment can calculate the speed
      of a projectile given either experimental distance results or
      the mass of a projectile and its kinetic energy. Like the above
      section, it can also calculate any of the other values, but only
      if a logical combination of other fields are filled in. For example,
      it will only calculate firing range (distance) if it is given
      a height, and a speed (or mass and energy, which can be used
      to calculate speed). Experiment, and find out what works.<BR>
      The &quot;Discharge Rate&quot; segment calculates the approximate
      time in seconds it would take to drain a capacitor through a
      bleeder resistor. Note that this is very approximate, and should
      not be used to calculate high-current pulse times. Use the above
      RLC Applet for that.</P>

      <H3>Kinetica</H3>

      <P>Kinetica is a simple applet to show you how far a theoretical
      projectile (no air resistance) can travel after being fired at
      any height, velocity, and angle. Simply input velocity, initial
      height, and firing angle in metric or standard units, and hit
      &quot;Calculate&quot;. It can also graph a relation of time to
      projectile height on the same axis (overlay).</P>

      <H3>Electromagnetic Force Simulator</H3>

      <P>The EMF Simulator is the crown jewel of my applet collection
      and represents many weeks of research and obsession. Input several
	  bits of information describing your coilgun and hit the calculate
	  button, and it will show you an RLC graph identical to the above
	  RLC Calculator, and a graph of the velocity of your projectile with
	  respect to time. Very useful for determining the optimum factors of
	  coilgunning, such as projectile and coil length, voltage, projectile
	  mass, and capacitance, among other things.</P>
