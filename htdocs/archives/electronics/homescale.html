      <FONT COLOR="#006000">April 26, 2004 - </FONT> There will be
	  more on this page shortly. I don't currently have access to my
	  coilguns, but I will in two weeks. This is the most recent update.
	  <p>
	  
	  <P>My home-scale coilgun will be designed to fire a 40mm long,
      2mm diameter iron projectile at around 55 m/sec. This will acheive
      a distance of around 54 feet when fired from 3 feet above the
      ground, and will hit the ground after approximately 0.305 second.
      It will operate from a rectified isolation transformer (170v
      DC) and charge 25 1000uf capacitors for a total of 361.25 joules.
      The coil will be wound from AWG 17 magnet wire and will ultimately
      be triggered by an optosensor circuit and have multiple stages.
      The coil will be conducting while the sensor is blocked, so I
      will use a solenoid of some sort to give the projectile an initial
      velocity.</P>

          <TD WIDTH="76%">
            <P>I have my isolation transformer, 15 capacitors, and my AWG
            17 coil set up now. I think I'll mount the coil and switch on
            a swivel-mount for a turret effect or on a semi-mobile rifle-style
            skeleton connected to the capacitors by long wires. My last operating
            setup consisted of an 800v 1A diode rectifying the output of
            the transformer. This 170v DC was fed into a 160uF photoflash
            cap, a 470uF 200v cap I got out of a TV, and two pairs of series
            connected 470uF 100v caps (a total of 470uF 200v). This gave
            me 15.9 joules, and I acheived 4 m/sec. Ugh, a measly 0.2% efficiency.
            Then again, I was using an incredibly bad coil. I hope I can
            determine the mass of my projectiles and the exact voltage on
            the capacitors soon, so I can calculate my efficiency.</P>

            <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Update! </FONT></B>I have decided
            to use <A HREF="graphics/multistage.gif">this multistage schematic</A>
            as my final destination. Therefore the IGBT Step has been replaced
            with a pulsed SCR step. I have also lowered the efficiency requirements
            for each stage, as efficiency is seeming much harder to attain
            and I am limited by 1000uF steps in the capacitors for now.

            the final version (to give me time to make some money).</P>

            <P>The third stage will be the largest step up, and I doubt I
            can even acheive it. If I do, however, my hobby will indeed be
            powerful, firing at between 67 m/sec and 126 m/sec, depending
            on the mass of my projectile (which I still haven't determined!).
